# Mitt Arv Blog Application

## About the Project

This project is a full-stack web application developed for the Software Engineering Internship at Mitt Arv. The application enables users to register, login, create blog posts, search posts, add comments, and manage their profile. It aims to provide a seamless legacy-tech blogging experience aligned with Mitt Arv’s vision.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React.js with Redux for state management
- Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB (Mongoose)
- Authentication: JWT-based user authentication and authorization
- Deployment: (Add your deployment platforms here, e.g., Render, Vercel)

## Features

- User registration and login with protected routes
- Create, read, update, delete blog posts
- Search blog posts by title and tags
- Add comments on individual posts
- User profile page to view user info and authored posts
- Responsive and clean UI (tailwind CSS removed in favor of custom CSS)
